            Toddlers and young children demand independence, however, q-tips can be hard to control and dangerous if inserted too far into the ear.

            The idea came form a task analysis focusing on morning routines in the bathroom. Being focused on Universal Design, the goal was to identify interactions or objects that could be difficult to use for disadvantaged user groups.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            I started ideating by writing out attributes I thought my solution should have, along with existing devices that I thought could work well. I then moved on to a cardboard prototype to get a feel for size and how the object would need to interact with the q-tip. From there I move on to a simple 3D printed prototype.

            Prototype Testing: Round One
        </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Up until this point I made the mistake of only testing my prototype with adults! As many moments of realization, I was in bed one day and realized I need to get my prototype into the hands of kids. I 3D printed twelve prototypes and sent them home with coworkers who had children ranging from one to fifteen years old.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            This turned out to be incredibly insightful because young children held the prototype in so many different ways. Looking at the pictures they tried everything from eating it, to gripping it like the handle bars of a bike, to using two hands to hold it. It isn't until about the age of five that children begin to hold the prototype like an adult; with a pencil like grip.

            Metrics
        </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Plotting the three major grip styles by age delineates how a child holds the prototype versus an adult. This could be attributed to several factors such as hand size, dexterity, familiarity with q-tips, or other factors.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            This data was collected in an unmoderated test where the prototype was given to parents to try at home with their kids. Because of this, there could have been coaching or other unknown factors not accounted for.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Early designs featured a hinge to keep the prototype closed, but this was prone to breaking and a difficult for children and adults to use. The hinge was replaced with magnets. The added benefit to this was the tops and bottoms were interchangeable between prototypes of various colors.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Unfortunately, loading was still difficult for children as the magnets used were far too strong. Only two out of nine participants successfully loaded on the first try and another three were successful on their second attempt; the rest took multiple attempts or needed the help of an adult. The attraction of the two halves was so strong the two halves would aggressively pull together within an inch, causing the q-tip to fall out.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Seven of the nine participants identifies the prototype as a caterpillar, and none were afraid or standoffish.
