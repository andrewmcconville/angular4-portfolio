            The Milwaukee area and its population have been shaped by Lake Michigan and the three rivers that flow into the lake.
            Topographical features such as the Menomonee river valley have split the city into distinct north and south sides.
            This project layers bodies of water along with terrain elevation, roads, and parcel values to build an understanding of how the city evolved into its current physical structure.

            Roads and waterways were included as a layer of data to compare again parcel values, however, roads and waterways provided an important method of orienting the viewer. 
            Viewers often locate areas of interest via a hierarchical search by first identifying large bodies of waters, such as lakes, then an interstate or river, followed by a local landmark, such as a park, airport, or similar large structure, and finally by local street.

            Topographic hillshade was included as a secondary data layer to act as a visual comparison between terrain features and land value.
            In the final print, however, the topography layer was given only a subtle visual prominence as its presence took away from and competed with the land value information.
