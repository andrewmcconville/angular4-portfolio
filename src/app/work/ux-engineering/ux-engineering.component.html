        <p class="article__paragraph">
            I have been a UX engineer with AccuLynx since January 2014 and in that time I have worked on dashboards, reporting tools, e-sign documents, calendaring, material ordering, insurance modules, and more; our software enables customers to run every aspect of a roofing company.

            My Role, My UX Hats
        </h3>

            UX Engineer
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            When I started at AccuLynx there was only one team, and zero UX roles. Over the years I have worn many UX hats; I have interviewed users, participated in remote usability studies, and on bigger projects contributed to design sprints. As we grew into multiple teams, I began documenting our design language to ensure a consistent user experience. Recently, much of my time has been spent building prototypes and components for our web app.

            Prototyping
        </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            I have used several design apps over the years including: Illustrator, XD, Sketch, and InVision, each having various strengths. However, when a clickable prototype won't cut it, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce native prototypes that run in the browser. This can be a huge advantage during usability testing as participants can interact with live data. The less participants have to suspend disbelief, the more realistic and valuable the observations will be.

            UX Explorations
        </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Have you ever thought to yourself "knowing what I know now, what would I do differently if I could start from scratch?"" After working on AccuLynx for a few years and building a deep understanding of our users, I used my 20% time to prototype a freemium experience for our SaaS app. I focused on self-onboarding and simplicity, while incentivising with high value features. We ultimately did not move forward with the project.

            UX Engineering
        </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
            At the end of the day, UX engineering is an end to end catch all; it spans research, design, testing, and development. One of the biggest takeaways from contributing to a product across several UX disciplines has been the old cliche: You are not your user. By having a deep understanding of users and the problem space, I minimize the risk and assumptions I bring into the solution space.
