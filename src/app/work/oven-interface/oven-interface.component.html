            This project is a prototyping framework to assess the balance between physical hardware inputs and on screen touch inputs.
            Accomplishing this goal was done by constructing a modular system composed of 3D printed housings, a touch screen running a web interface, and keyboard switches.
            These elements were able to be quickly disassembled and rearranged into various configurations to be tested with users.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Users can have difficulty identifying a starting point when attempting to turn on the oven.
            Once powered on, some users are met with a brief moment of cognitive overload from a cluttered interface.

            The touch screen is powered by a Raspberry Pi, while the hardware buttons are keyboard switches connected to an Arduino.
            This allowed for buttons to be quickly added and removed and the Arduino could be connected to a Mac or PC for easy debugging.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            The properties of a button almost led to a project of its own.
            What size should they be; and what about the shape, finish, typography and labeling, feel and resistance, travel distance, sound, and lighting?
            Each of these items listed also contained their own properties making for a very long list of considerations.
            Being a prototype, the minimal solution was produced: a plain white 3D printed button, without sound or lighting queues.
