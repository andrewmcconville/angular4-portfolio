                        Hi, I’m Andrew McConville.
                        <br />
                        I'm a UX professional with a background in B2B SaaS applications.

                    <h2 class="article__subheading">UX Research &amp; Design Philosophy</h2>
                    <p class="article__paragraph">
                        I believe a great user experience comes from uncovering a deep understanding your users needs and goals,
                        along with adhering to the mantra: you are not your user.
                        I’m also a believer in having all roles present during ideation:
                        design, engineering, QA, PMs, marketing; bring them all to the design sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__paragraph">
                        I'm also a stickler for consistency and feel great UX design comes from adhering to a well documented and maintained design system.
                        Teach users your design language once, then stay out of their way.
                        Good UX should be invisible.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="article__subheading">UX Process</h2>
                    <p class="article__paragraph">
                        I follow Design Thinking methodologies,
                        and believe rigorous user research throughout the process is a requirement to delivering a truly useful product.

                                User interviews and analytics,
                                combined with ethnographic analysis, 
                                are the foundation to building meaningful personas and experience maps.
                                These tools allow for uncovering the needs and goals users have.

                                Understand the pain points and write a User Centered Problem Statement,
                                then come back to it religiously to stay on track.
                                Generate a research hypothesis and a metric to validate against to measure success.

                                The best part of the design sprint:
                                sketch new possibilities, diverge on radical ideas, affinity map a starting point. 
                                Converge on <i>a</i> possible best solution, which still might not be <i>the</i> solution.

                                The time to "Move fast and break things."
                                Build paper prototypes,
                                sticky note prototypes,
                                wireframe prototypes,
                                or even working prototypes.

                                Gather participants to click, tap, and reveal hidden flaws.
                                Validate outcomes with metrics from
                                survey data,
                                behavioral and attitudinal research,
