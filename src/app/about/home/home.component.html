                    <p class="article__paragraph">
                        I believe a great user experience is when the learning curve is kept low, which I'm always trying to iterate toward through design thinking methodologies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article__paragraph">
                        This requires an understanding of both user and business goals.
                        Great UX also thrives on design consistency, which takes the form of a well documented and maintained design system.
                        I believe in teaching users a design language once by providing a consistent interaction patterns and a consistent look and feel.

                                Research how the product fits in with the bigger picture of their daily lives?
                                Dig in with interviews, task analysis, contextual inquiry, journey mapping, personas, and usage analytics.

                                Diverge on radical ideas, focusing on possibilities that are novel and have never been tried in the past.
                                Converge on <i>a</i> possible solution, which might not be <i>the</i> solution.

                            <p>
                                My favorite phase.
                                I enjoying lo-fi paper protyping and hi-fi clickable mocks, but native prototyping in code is what I enjoy the most.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Test.</p>
                            <p>
                                And now that we have a prototype, we can test!
                                Users can click, tap, and of course find all the flaws in what was thought to be a production ready experience.
